## Topics for PyTorch Hack 2020

### Speech Denoising(App Idea)
The aim is to remove/reduce noise from speech data and/or enhance the speech aspect of it. Data will be in audio format, model will be trained on waveform of images of the audio data. Practical applications include noise removal from recorded audio, like lectures and real time noise reduction in online meetings.

### POS Tagging/ Word Embeddings on Code-Mixed text(Tool for PyTorch Idea)
The aim is to either generate word embeddings or tag parts-of-speech in a code mixed corpus. A code mixed corpus is one that consists of words from two different languages. Mostly we will go with Hindi-English corpus. A word embedder like word2vec or a postagger will be a very helpful NLP tool in general.
