## Text-to-voice converter
The task would be to create a text to voice generater that can mimic our end-user's voice. The method implemented in the paper takes a 5 second audio input of a person's speech and then is able to convert any text to a natural speech with that voice.\
A possible application for this can be creating Online lecture videos in Colleges, the teachers can just upload their lecture material ot our website/app and have it converted to speech. Then attach it to their ppts.
